\item{thetalist}{list of (N by L_m) matrices representing X_m}

\item{psilist}{list of basis matrices}

\item{rho}{(S by M) matrix of rho_m draws}

\item{gamma}{list of (S by P_z) matrices with gamma draws}

\item{lambdaInverse}{S-vector of lambda^{-1} draws}

\item{lambdaBInverse}{S-vector of lambda^{-1}_B draws}

\item{sigma2}{S-vector of sigma^2 draws}

\item{weightslist}{list of (S by L_m) weight matrices to apply to exposures X_m (basically A theta^*, so that X*theta*=x(Atheta*))}

\item{poly}{0 = gaussian kernel, 1 = polynomial kernel}

\item{d}{degree of polynomial kernel}

\item{randint}{0 = no random intercepts, 1 = random intercepts model}

\item{Bmat}{N xN block diagonal matrix indicating cluster membership for random intercepts model}
